    rollingAverage(y :: Vector, p :: Int; centered::Bool = true, discard::Bool = false, offset::Int = 0)

Computes the moving average of the vector y with p data points.

With centered equal true, p has to be an odd number so that an equal number of leads and lags can be used. By default
when centered = false, the computation includes the datum plus its most recent (p-1) lagged value.
This behavior can be changed by including an offset; a positive offset includes one additonal lead at
the expense of the oldest lag value

For discard=false the function rolls over all data, even if not all p data points can be used.
